# HNG-NumberClassification-API

This is a GitHub Repo for a number classification API that I built as a task during my HNG internship. For this task, I created a Flask-based API that can take a number and return interesting mathematical properties about it along with fun facts about that particular number. This API gets a number via a GET request and returns a JSON containing the classification, fun fact and properties. The properties to be returned include Armstrong, prime, perfect, odd and even.
